                    List                                                            Array

Can consist of elements belonging to different data types       	Only consists of elements belonging to the same data type

No need to explicitly import a module for declaration	            Need to explicitly import a module for declaration

Cannot directly handle arithmetic operations	                    Can directly handle arithmetic operations

Can be nested to contain different type of elements	                Must contain either all nested elements of same size

Preferred for shorter sequence of data items	                    Preferred for longer sequence of data items

Greater flexibility allows easy modification (addition, deletion) 	Less flexibility since addition, deletion has to be done element  of data                                                             wise

The entire list can be printed without any explicit looping	        A loop has to be formed to print or access the components of array

Consume larger memory for easy addition of elements	                Comparatively more compact in memory size
