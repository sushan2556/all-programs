for i in range(8): #for loop with range function
    print(i) # will print till 7 counts from 0 to 7

# you can specify from where the range should start 
for i in range(2,8): #will justify the index from where to start the print function and till where
    print(i)
# range can be used in (start, stop, step size)
#example on above range(1, 8, 2) this will pront from first index, to 8th index and skip everysecond number
